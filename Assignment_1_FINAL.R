##### Introduction
# I believe that dolphins are some of the most fascinating animals on this planet. They are one of the few groups of animals capable of forming and maintaining complex social structures, and also have one of the largest brain to body mass ratios (Connor, 2007; Marino et al., 2006). The Delphinidae family (more commonly known as "oceanic dolphins" or "delphinids") is said to be comprised of 37 species (McGowen et al., 2019). However, it is noted that the phylogeny and classification of this taxonomic group is not completely understood due to several factors such as recent adaptive radiation and hybridization (McGowen et al., 2019). 
# The geographic distribution of delphinids varies widely as they can be found in every ocean and nearly every sea in the world (Forcada, 2009). As a result, I am interested in analyzing the geographic distribution of this family. Specifically, I want to know the number of species and BINs within the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Furthermore, I want to also compare the BIN composition of this family between the two oceans.

##### Part 1 - Data Exploration

# BIN and species data
# To start off, I will look into how many unique BINs are found within the dataset. 
# Then I will also look at how many unique species are identified in our dataset and compare the results.

# How many missing BINs are there?
sum(is.na(df_Delphinidae$bin_uri)) # 177 missing BINs in our data, which means that most of the records have a BIN associated with them.

# How many unique BINs are there?
length(unique(na.omit(df_Delphinidae$bin_uri))) # There are 24 unique BINs in the Delphinidae data frame (excluding missing values)

# How many records don't have a species name associated with them?
sum(is.na(df_Delphinidae$species_name)) # 14 records don't have a species name associated with them (NA)

# How many unique species are found in this dataset? How does this compare to the amount of species found in the literature?
length(unique(na.omit(df_Delphinidae$species_name))) # At least 29 unique species in this data frame, whereas the literature states there are 37 species (McGowen et al., 2019)

#What is the ratio of BINs to species? 
length(unique(na.omit(df_Delphinidae$bin_uri))) / length(unique(na.omit(df_Delphinidae$species_name)))
# We get a ratio of 0.828, which means...
# Mention this in discussion             

# Now I will be taking a closer look into the records that don't have a species name associated with them.
# How many of these records without a species name have a BIN associated with them?
df_BINspeciesname <- select(df_Delphinidae, "bin_uri", "species_name") # Used the select() function from the dplyr package to subset the 2 columns from the df_Delphinidae data frame and put them into a new data frame.

# filter function is used to filter every record that has a BIN, but does not have a species name associated with it.
BINs_nospecies <- df_BINspeciesname %>%
  filter(!is.na(bin_uri)) %>%
  filter(is.na(species_name))
BINs_nospecies
# We get 3 records that have BINs that don't have a species name associated with them, but only 2 of them are unique: BOLD:ABY4191 and BOLD:AAD4421


# We can search for both of these BINs within the dataframe to see if there any matches:
# BOLD:ABY4181
df_ABY4181 <- df_Delphinidae %>%
  select(species_name, bin_uri) %>%
  filter(bin_uri == "BOLD:ABY4181")
df_ABY4181
# It appears that this BIN can be associated with the Stenella longirostris species.


# BOLD:AAD4421
df_AAD4421 <- df_Delphinidae %>%
  select(species_name, bin_uri) %>%
  filter(bin_uri == "BOLD:AAD4421")
df_AAD4421
# Interestingly, there are many different species associated with this particular BIN.

df_AAD4421 %>%
  group_by(species_name) %>%
  filter(!is.na(species_name)) %>%
  count()
# Specifically, there are at least 7 different species associated with this BIN!

# Let's check if the members of this BIN are within the same genus.
df_AAD4421_genus <- df_Delphinidae %>%
  select(species_name, bin_uri, genus_name) %>%
  group_by(genus_name) %>%
  filter(bin_uri == "BOLD:AAD4421")
length(unique(df_AAD4421_genus$genus_name)) 
# Specimens with this BIN are associated with 4 different genera.


# What are the 3 most common species in the dataset? 
# Make a variable for the table of the frequency of each species in the dataset.
spec_count <- table(df_Delphinidae$species_name)
spec_count
# Then we can sort that table in ascending order, and return the names of the last 3 species with the names() function and tail() function
tail(names(sort(spec_count, decreasing = FALSE)), 3) # Gives the top 3 most common species: "Orcinus orca", "Tursiops truncatus", and "Stenella longirostris"


# Check the distribution of the institution_storing variable to see where most of the data is from. 
sum(is.na(df_Delphinidae$institution_storing)) # There are no NA's in this variable
length(unique(df_Delphinidae$institution_storing)) # There are 6 unique values for the institution_storing variable


# Looking at the distribution of the source of the sequence data. 
# I will make a table of all the different values for the institution_storing variable, as well as the count for each one of them.
inst_count_table <- df_Delphinidae %>% 
  group_by(institution_storing) %>% 
  count() %>%
  arrange(-n)

# Overwhelmingly mined from GenBank, not very interesting. 



##### Part 2 - Analysis to address my main research question(s): What is the geographical distribution of the Delphinidae family between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean? Also, how does the BIN composition of the Delphinidae family compare between the Atlantic and Pacific ocean?

##### Geographical data analysis

# How many missing values for the country variable?
sum(is.na(df_Delphinidae$country)) # 867 missing values for the country variable, which isn't very good for analyzing geographic distribution, but we will work with what we have.
# Number of unique countries in our dataset?
length(unique(na.omit(df_Delphinidae$country))) # 20 unique countries

# Which country is the origin of the most records in our dataset?
df_CountryRecords <- df_Delphinidae %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(!is.na(country)) %>%
  count()
  tail(arrange(df_CountryRecords, n), 1) # Brazil has the most records (86)
  

# Looking at records that don't have a specific country name, but were instead associated with the ocean they were collected from
nonspecific_records <- grep("Ocean", df_Delphinidae$country) # Use the grep() function to match the word "ocean" in my dataset and then getting the process IDs of these records
df_Delphinidae$processid[nonspecific_records] # We have 8 records that don't have a specific country associated with them (that aren't missing values)


# How many missing values for the longitude and latitude variables?
sum(is.na(df_Delphinidae$lon)) 
sum(is.na(df_Delphinidae$lat)) 
# 988 missing values for both longitude and latitude, which is unfortunate, but we will work with what we have.

# The goal is to look at the geographical distribution of the Delphinidae family
# In particular, I'd like to analyze and compare their distribution/composition between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

# I need to organize records with longitude/latitude data into separate groups that correspond with the specimen's ocean of origin.

# Making a subset dateframe of the columns we're going to use for this process:
df_Delphinidae_subset1 <- select(df_Delphinidae, "species_name", "bin_uri", "lat", "lon", "country")

# Filter for records that have longitude and latitude data
df_Delphinidae_subset1 <- df_Delphinidae_subset1 %>%
  filter(!is.na(lat)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(lon))

# Defining Atlantic ocean boundaries 
# The 20° meridian east longitude is considered to be the eastern boundary of the Atlantic ocean (where it meets the Indian ocean)
# The -67° longitude is the western boundary of the Atlantic ocean (where it meets the Pacific ocean)

df_Delphinidae_Atlantic <- df_Delphinidae_subset1 %>% 
  filter(20 >= lon) %>%
  filter(-67 <= lon)

# The 146° longitude corresponds to the western border of the Pacific, all the way to the -67° longitude where it meets with the Atlantic Ocean
df_Delphinidae_Pacific <- df_Delphinidae_subset1 %>%
  filter(146 <= lon | -67 >= lon)
# There are 9 records that were collected from the Pacific ocean.

# Defining Indian ocean boundaries
# For the Indian Ocean, we will take latitude into consideration (30° North).
df_Delphinidae_Indian <- df_Delphinidae_subset1 %>%
  filter(146 >= lon) %>%
  filter(20 <= lon) %>%
  filter(30 >= lat)
# There are 3 records that were collected from the Indian ocean.

# There is one more record from Greece that does not fall into any of these groups.
# We can assume this sample was taken from the Mediterranean Sea based off of its coordinates.
df_Delphinidae_Medi <- df_Delphinidae_subset1 %>%
  filter(6 <= lon) %>%
  filter(36 >= lon) %>%
  filter(30 <= lat) %>%
  filter(46 >= lat)

# Now that every record with longitude/latitude data has been grouped into their appropriate groups, we can analyze each group separately.

# I wanted to visualize the data points that had a GPS coordinate associated with them on a world map.

# How similar is the BIN composition between the Atlantic and Pacific ocean groups?

# There are many algorithms to choose from for the vegdist() function. I chose the bray-curtis algorithm for the purposes of this assignment because it is known to be sufficient for detecting underlying ecological gradients. (Source: https://peat-clark.github.io/BIO381/veganTutorial.html )

##### Part 3 - Results & Discussion
# As mentioned before, the literature states that there are 37 known species that make up the Delphinidae family (McGowen et al., 2019). While exploring the Delphinidae dataset (n = 1100 samples) from the BOLD database, only 29 unique species were able to be identified. Additionally, there were only 24 unique BINs. With this information I was able to calculate a ratio of unique BIN to unique species: 0.828. While exploring the dataset, I also found some samples with BINs that did not have a species name associated with them. Specifically, one of the BINs (BOLD:AAD4421) was found to be associated with 7 different species of the Delphinidae family. These results indicate that different species were assigned to the same BIN. As mentioned before, the Delphinidae family has undergone recent adaptive radiation and hybridization, which might result in some ambiguity when looking at the phylogenetic relationships within this family (McGowen et al., 2019). The adaptive radiation of this family might be a result of its wide geographic distribution, leading to increased intraspecific divergence as a result (Gaytan et al., 2020). I then went on to look into where the specimen data was obtained from. Disappointingly, most of the data was mined from GenBank which was not very interesting. Only a small fraction of the data was actually obtained from institutions (43 out of 1100 records). 
# To answer my research question, I needed to organize my data into separate groups using GPS coordinate data. Unfortunately, only 112 records from the dataset had this data available so it was not totally representative of the entire dataset. Nonetheless, these records were organized into groups based on their coordinate data. Then, I used this to create a map showcasing the location each data point was taken from (Figure 1). There was a notable difference in the amount of samples taken from the Atlantic Ocean (n = 99) compared to the Pacific Ocean (n = 9). Despite this difference, they had nearly the same number of unique BINs (Figure 2). I thought that this was very interesting, as this might indicate increased diversity in the Pacific relative to the Atlantic. However, a larger sample size and more research would have to be done to arrive to that conclusion. Finally, I went on to compare the BIN composition of this family between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This was done by calculating dissimilarity indices between the unique BINs for each group (Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean) and then displaying the scores on a histogram (Figure 3). The calculation of these indices was done by using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity algorithm, which is regularly used in ecological analyses (Clark, 2017). The results of this algorithm will return a distance matrix between values 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a high degree of dissimilarity. Because I am only comparing two geographic regions (Atlantic vs Pacific), there is only one dissimilarity index that is returned (0.926). This score indicates a large dissimilarity between the BIN compositions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This is indicative of a high level of genetic divergence among this family probably due to their geographic separation. Again, an increased sample size would have given us more accurate and representative results for this analysis. Future research in this topic could involve a deeper look into the effect of geographic distribution on the genetic divergence of a taxonomic group. Specifically, looking at their distribution across different latitudes could grant more insight into the ambiguous phylogeny of this family.
